### EN/UVLO Divider Calculation

Target: Enable at VIN = 3.3 V

- VUVLO = 1.23 V  
- R1 / R2 = (3.3 / 1.23) – 1 = **1.683**

Choose R2 = 100 kΩ → R1 = 100 kΩ × 1.683 = **168.3 kΩ**  
→ Use standard values: **R1 = 169 kΩ**, **R2 = 100 kΩ**

**Hysteresis:**

- I_HYS = 1.5 µA  
- ΔV = R1 × I_HYS = 169 kΩ × 1.5 µA = **0.25 V**

**Result:**  
- Turn-on at ~3.3 V  
- Turn-off at ~3.05 V  
- Divider: 169 kΩ / 100 kΩ

### MODE Pin Configuration

The MODE pin is tied to VIN to enable **Forced PWM mode**.

**Reasoning:**

- Forced PWM maintains a constant switching frequency (320 kHz), even at light loads
- Provides stable output voltage with minimal ripple
- Avoids audible noise or unpredictable behavior caused by pulse skipping
- Better suited for systems with sensitive analog or digital loads
- Efficiency is not a critical concern at 250 mA load

**Conclusion:**  
Forced PWM mode ensures clean, stable operation across the full load range. The MODE pin is therefore connected directly to VIN.

### ILIM Pin Current Limit Setting

Target peak current (from inductor calc): ~1.59 A  
Desired valley current limit: ≥ 2.0 A (with margin)

**Formula:**  
Ivalley = 400,000 / RLIM

**Calculations:**

- For Ivalley = 2.0 A → RLIM = 200 kΩ  
- For Ivalley = 2.2 A → RLIM ≈ 182 kΩ

**Selected value:** RLIM = 180 kΩ  
→ Ivalley = 400,000 / 180,000 = **2.22 A**

**Conclusion:**  
RLIM = 180 kΩ ensures safe operation with margin above peak inductor current. ILIM is connected to AGND through this resistor.

### M/SYNC Pin Configuration

The M/SYNC pin is connected to GND.

**Reasoning:**
- Disables external clock synchronization
- Enables internal fixed switching frequency (1 MHz)
- Prevents floating logic level

**Conclusion:**
M/SYNC tied to ground ensures the TPS61287 operates using its internal clock, simplifying the design and ensuring predictable PWM behavior.

### CBOOT Capacitor Selection

**Function:**  
CBOOT provides gate drive voltage for the high-side N-MOSFET during each switching cycle. It acts as a **bootstrap capacitor** between the BOOT and SW pins, allowing full enhancement of the high-side switch.

**Recommendation from datasheet:**  
CBOOT = 0.1 µF to 1.0 µF (ceramic, low ESR)

**Selected value:**  
CBOOT = **0.1 µF (100 nF)**

**Reasoning:**
- 0.1 µF is sufficient for driving small gate charge of external MOSFET (AO3400A, Qg ≈ 4.5 nC)
- Lower capacitance = faster charge/discharge, lower stress on BOOT circuit
- Reduces inrush current during turn-on of high-side MOSFET
- Minimizes switching delay and avoids undervoltage on gate
- Small size (0402 or 0603) → easy placement close to BOOT/SW pins
- Matches typical reference designs for similar load conditions

**Conclusion:**  
100 nF ceramic cap provides reliable gate charge for high-side MOSFET, ensures fast switching and stable operation. Cap is placed physically close to BOOT and SW pins to minimize parasitics.

### Input Capacitor Selection (CIN1 + CIN2)

**Function:**  
Input capacitors filter high-frequency switching current from the boost converter and suppress voltage ripple on VIN.

**Recommendation from datasheet:**  
- 22 µF ceramic minimum  
- Use additional bulk capacitor if powered through long wires (e.g., wall adapter)  
- Ceramic for low ESR, tantalum for damping cable-induced ringing

**Selected configuration:**
- **CIN1 = 22 µF Tantalum** → bulk capacitance, damping of line ringing  
- **CIN2 = 22 µF Ceramic (X7R)** → low ESR, high-frequency filtering  
- Combined total = 44 µF effective input capacitance

**Reasoning:**
- Ceramic capacitor suppresses high-frequency switching noise from inductor and MOSFETs  
- Tantalum capacitor damps ringing caused by long supply wires or inductive input paths  
- Combined structure handles both ripple and transient ringing effectively  
- Capacitors are placed close to VIN pin for minimal trace inductance

**Conclusion:**  
CIN1 + CIN2 combination ensures stable VIN, suppresses ripple and prevents destructive ringing, in full accordance with TI recommendations for boost converters.
